# What it does

Generate page files that can be imported to [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/)  to have an easy "zoom in - zoom out" time navigation.

The structure of the pages follows this awesome post on [How I quickly navigate in time](https://forum.roamresearch.com/t/how-i-quickly-navigate-in-time/610)

# Usage

`python generate.py year output_dir`

for example

`python generate.py 2021 pages`

to generate pages for year `2021` and write the output files to `pages` directory.

Then import all the pages generated by the script to Roam
